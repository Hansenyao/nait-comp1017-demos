    <h1>The Figure Element</h1>
    <img src="img/image1.jpg" alt="A small dog.">

    <p>In HTML, the figure tag is used to include self-contained information such as illustrations, diagrams, or code listings in a document. It is linked to the main flow, but it may be used at any place of a document, and the figure flows with the content, thus removing it should not impact the flow of the document. HTML5 includes a new tag for this purpose.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="img/image3.jpg" alt="A fluffy dog.">
        <img src="img/image4.jpg" alt="A dog laying in the grass.">
        <img src="img/image5.jpg" alt="A brown dog.">
        <figcaption>
            The figure tag comes with an optional figcaption element and can even contain multiple images with a single caption. The caption belongs to the image and not the main document.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>The Difference Between Figure and Image Tags</h2>

    <figure>
        <img src="img/image2.jpg" alt="A dog table.">
        <figcaption>The image tag is used to add an image to an HTML page.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>A figure is used to semantically organize or group the content of images, diagrams, blocks of code, and / or a caption in the document. It provides a way to wrap this content and group it together</p>
