        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>A style sheet is simply a text file that contains one or more rules that determine (through properties and values) how certain elements in your Web page should be displayed.</p>

            <h2>Creating an External Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>External style sheets are ideal for giving most or all of the pages on your Web site a consistent look. You can define all your styles in an external style sheet and then tell each page on your site to load the external sheet, thu ensuring that each will have the same settings. Although you will learn about embedded and inline styles, adding CSS to your page from an external style sheet is a best practice, so it is recommened that you use this method (allowing for occasional exceptions).</p>

                <h3>How to create and link an external style sheet:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new file document in your text editor.</li>
                    <li>Save the document in the desired directory with the name "styles" and the extension ".css" to designate it as a Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
                    <li>Create a link to this file in the head of the document (after the title tag) of each HTML page in which you wish to use the style sheet. &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href=""&gt;</li>
                    <li>Include the relative path to the CSS file in the href attribute.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Creating an Embedded Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>An embedded style sheet is the second way to apply CSS to a page. It lets you set the styles directly in the HTML document you want to affect (typically it goes in the head). Because the styles are in that HTML file only, the CSS won't apply to other pages like a liked external style sheet does, and you won't get the same caching benefits either. As mentioned earlier, an external style sheet is the recommended approach for most cases, but it's important to understand your options for the times you'll need to deviate.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>To create an embedded style sheet:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type &lt;style&gt; in the head section of the HTML document.</li>
                    <li>Define as many style rules as desired.</li>
                    <li>Type &lt;/style&gt; to complete the embedded style sheet.</li>
                </ol>

        <section>
            <h2>Applying Inline Styles</h2>
            <p>Inline styles are the third way to apply CSS to HTML. However, they are by far the least desirable option because they intertwine your content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), a slap in the face to best practices.</p>
            <p>An inline style affects only one element, so you lose one of the key benefits an external style sheet provides: Write once and see everywhere. Imagine having to sift through a slew of HTML pages to make a simple font color change, and you can see why inline styles aren't intended for regular use.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>To apply inline styles:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type style=" within the HTML open tag of the element that you want to format.</li>
                    <li>Create a style rule without curly brackets  or a selector. The selector isn't necessary since you're placing it directly inside the desired element.</li>
                    <li>To create additional style definitions, type ; (a semicolon) and repeat step 2.</li>
                    <li>Type the final quote mark ".</li>
                </ol>
